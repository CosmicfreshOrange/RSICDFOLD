the suspension bridge is across the broad river
here is a double tower stayed cable bridge across the river with two ships traveling in
the cable stayed bridge crosses the dark green river
the cable stayed bridge straightly spans the river which has roads and rows of trees on its banks
some green plants are in two sides of a river with a bridge over it
