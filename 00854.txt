at the junction of the roads, a large baseball field comes into view
a fan-shaped playground and not far away from a crossroad
a baseball field surrounded by green trees is near a parking lot
a baseball field surrounded by many green trees is next to a crossroads
a baseball field surrounded by many green trees is next to a road
