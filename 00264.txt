the structure of this magneficent overpass is very complex since it connects the large open space and some residential areas nearby
a broad bridge and many black cars on it
a bridge is on a small river with baseball fields on two sides of it
a long bridge is on a small river with two baseball fields on the banks of it
two baseball fields are not far from a long bridge
