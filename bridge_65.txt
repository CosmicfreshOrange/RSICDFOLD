the bridege joins the two  green banks of the turbid river
a road cross the river with trees growing along has rows of automobiles traveling orderly
many cars are passing on the bridge which is on the brown river
the bustling bridge spans the brown river with rows of trees on its banks
many cars are on a bridge over a river with many green plants in two sides
