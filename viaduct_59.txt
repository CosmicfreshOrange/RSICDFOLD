two circular ramps of the viaduct forms into a shape like a owl's eyes
there are two loops in the viaduct
two circular ramps of the viaduct forms into a shape like a owl's eyes
the slightly curved viaduct spans the bustling wide straight highway road on the ground
some scattered green trees and a pond are near a viaduct
