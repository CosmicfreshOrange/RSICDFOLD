the broad road is across the stretch of river like a boomerang
a bridge with two branch road on a bridgehead is built over the turning area of a river
the bridge as a freeway links two villages
a prosperous city area is seperated by a curved river with a bustling wide bridge connecting them
several buildings and some green trees are in two sides of a river with several cars on it
