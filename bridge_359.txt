the two bridges with gridding steel beams joins the back covered by trees
two truss bridges cross the river parallelly
a bridge with iron trestle links the forests
two paralleled tied arch bridge traverse the wide river with rows of trees on its banks
some green trees are in two sides of a river with two parallel bridges
