the quicksand forms into circles in the desert with crystal clear ponds
we can see wood grain on the desert with lakes
the blue green lake is next to the desert which has the strip of annual ring
a green pool can be seen in this bleak light brown desert
a green irregular pond is in a piece of yellow desert
