the bridge like a boomerang is across the ring with a eyot
here is a y shaped bridge built over a y shaped river
the polygonal shape bridge has three roads
it is a radial bridge connecting boths banks of the river and the island
some cars are on a curved bridge over a river with an island in it connected to the bridge
