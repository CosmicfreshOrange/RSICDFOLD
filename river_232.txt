the twisty brown river is across the dense forest
the yellow river winding through the rainforest has several lakes and tributary rivers around it
the twisty brown river is across the dense forest
there is a brook joins the brown twisted river passing through this peaceful forest
many green trees are in two sides of a curved brown river
